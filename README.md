# Seperate_Chaining_Collision
C Program For Seperate Chaining Collision

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

    I. This technique creates a linked list to the slot for which collision occurs.
    II. The new key is then inserted in the linked list.
    III. These linked lists to the slots appear like chains.
    IV. That is why, this technique is called as separate chaining.
