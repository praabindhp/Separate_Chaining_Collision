# Separate_Chaining_Collision
C Program For Separate Chaining Collision

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

Separate Chaining is a collision resolution technique that handles collision by creating a linked list to the bucket of hash table for which collision occurs.

    I. This technique creates a linked list to the slot for which collision occurs.
    II. The new key is then inserted in the linked list.
    III. These linked lists to the slots appear like chains.
    IV. That is why, this technique is called as separate chaining.
